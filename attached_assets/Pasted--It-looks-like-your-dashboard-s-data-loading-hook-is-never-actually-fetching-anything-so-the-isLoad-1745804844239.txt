It looks like your dashboard’s data-loading hook is never actually fetching anything, so the isLoadingCourses flag stays true and you get an infinite spinner. There are two root causes here:
	1.	You never give React-Query a queryFn to actually go and fetch /api/professor/courses.
In your queryClient.ts you’re passing a getQueryFn(...) into your default options, but you never import or define getQueryFn, so your client ends up with no queryFn at all.
	2.	Your manual refetch helper uses queryClient.invalidateQueries but you never import queryClient into your dashboard component, so clicking “Fetch Courses” also does nothing.

⸻

1) Define a real getQueryFn (or give your hook its own queryFn)

Option A: Fix your global default

In lib/queryClient.ts, add (or import) a working getQueryFn above your new QueryClient(...). For example:

// lib/queryClient.ts
import { QueryClient, QueryFunctionContext } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { apiRequest } from './apiRequest';     // wherever you put your fetch wrapper
import { throwIfResNotOk } from './apiRequest'; // that helper you already have

export function getQueryFn({ on401 }: { on401: 'returnNull' | 'throw' }) {
  return async ({ queryKey }: QueryFunctionContext) => {
    // we assume queryKey is [url: string]
    const url = queryKey[0] as string;
    const res = await apiRequest('GET', url);
    await throwIfResNotOk(res);
    return (await res.json()) as any;
  };
}

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      queryFn: getQueryFn({ on401: 'returnNull' }),
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      staleTime: 60_000,
      retry: false,
    },
    mutations: { retry: false },
  },
});

Make sure getQueryFn is actually in scope here (no more “undefined”!).

Option B: Give your dashboard hook its own fetcher

If you’d rather not fix a global default, you can inline the fetch logic in your useQuery call:

// in Dashboard.tsx
const {
  data: courses = [],
  isLoading: isLoadingCourses,
  error: coursesError,
  refetch
} = useQuery<Course[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/professor/courses'],
  enabled: !!user,
  queryFn: async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/professor/courses', {
      method: 'GET',
      credentials: 'include',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    if (!res.ok) {
      const text = await res.text();
      throw new Error(`${res.status}: ${text}`);
    }
    return res.json();
  }
});



⸻

2) Import and use your queryClient for manual invalidation

Your manualFetchCourses calls queryClient.invalidateQueries(...), but you never bring that queryClient into scope. At the top of Dashboard.tsx, add:

import { queryClient } from '@/lib/queryClient';

Now your “Fetch Courses” button will actually clear the cache and let React-Query rerun that fixed queryFn.

⸻

Quick sanity checks
	1.	Wrap your entire app in <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}> (usually in your root/layout component).
	2.	Open the browser console/network tab and verify:
	•	Console logs from your dashboard (you already have console.log("ProfessorDashboard - Auth state:", …) and “Attempting manual fetch…”).
	•	A real network request to /api/professor/courses returning 200 and a JSON array.
	•	Then isLoadingCourses should go true → false, and you’ll see your grid rather than the spinner.

Once you either define that getQueryFn or inline a queryFn, and pull in your queryClient, the infinite load should disappear and your courses will render.

Let me check if this diagnosis is accurate by examining your codebase. I'll need to look at the React Query setup and the dashboard component implementation.

First, let's find the query client configuration file:

Based on my review of your codebase, the diagnosis you shared is not accurate. Let me explain why:

Regarding the first issue (missing queryFn):
In /client/src/lib/queryClient.ts, there is a properly defined getQueryFn function that's exported and correctly used in the QueryClient configuration:
typescript
CopyInsert
export const getQueryFn: <T>(options: {
  on401: UnauthorizedBehavior;
}) => QueryFunction<T> =
  ({ on401: unauthorizedBehavior }) =>
  async ({ queryKey }) => {
    // Implementation that uses fetch with the query key
    // and handles responses appropriately
  };

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      queryFn: getQueryFn({ on401: "returnNull" }),
      // other options...
    },
  },
});
Regarding the second issue (missing queryClient import):
In /client/src/pages/professor/Dashboard.tsx, the queryClient is properly imported:
typescript
CopyInsert
import { apiRequest, queryClient } from '@/lib/queryClient';
And it's correctly used in the manualFetchCourses function to invalidate queries:
typescript
CopyInsert
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['/api/professor/courses'] });
Your React Query setup appears to be correctly configured. The infinite loading issue must be caused by something else. Potential areas to investigate:

Are you properly wrapping your app with QueryClientProvider?
Is the API endpoint /api/professor/courses actually returning data?
Are there any network errors in the browser console?
Is the enabled: !!user condition preventing the query from running?
If you're still experiencing infinite loading, I'd recommend adding additional debug logging or checking the network tab in your browser's dev tools to see if the request to /api/professor/courses is actually being made and what response it's returning.

Sorry for the confusion—let’s walk through some targeted checks now that we know your React-Query setup and imports are correct.

⸻

1. Make sure your app is wrapped in a QueryClientProvider

If you forget this, none of your queries will ever fire (and you won’t get the usual “No QueryClient set” error). In your top-level (e.g. App.tsx or root layout) you should have:

import { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { queryClient } from '@/lib/queryClient';

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {children}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
export default App;

Double-check that this provider actually wraps your ProfessorDashboard (and that you haven’t accidentally scoped it only around student pages, etc.).

⸻

2. Verify the network request is actually going out

Open your browser DevTools → Network tab, reload the dashboard, and look for a GET /api/professor/courses request.
	•	If you don’t see it:
	•	Temporarily remove the enabled: !!user flag (or change to enabled: true) to rule out an auth-state issue.
	•	Add a console.log inside your getQueryFn or inline queryFn to confirm it’s executing at all.
	•	If you do see it but it never resolves:
	•	Check the response status code and payload.
	•	Ensure your server isn’t hanging (e.g. missing a call to res.json(...) or stuck in middleware).

⸻

3. Instrument your hook with callbacks

Add onSuccess / onError handlers to see exactly what React-Query is observing:

const { data: courses = [], isLoading, error, refetch } = useQuery<Course[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/professor/courses'],
  enabled: true,            // for debugging, disable the enabled guard
  onSuccess(data) {
    console.log('✅ courses fetched:', data);
  },
  onError(err) {
    console.error('❌ courses query error:', err);
  }
});

That will tell you if the query ever succeeds or errors out.

⸻

4. Double-check your useUser state

Because you guard with enabled: !!user, if user never becomes non-null, your query will never run and isLoading stays idle (but sometimes appears as loading).
	•	In your Dashboard you already log:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Auth state:', { isAuthenticated: !!user, user });
}, [user]);

Confirm that this log shows { isAuthenticated: true, user: { … } } before you expect courses to load.

⸻

5. Look for CORS or credentials issues

Because you’re using credentials: 'include', a mis-configured CORS policy can silently block your request. In the Network tab:
	•	Check for a CORS preflight that’s blocked.
	•	Ensure your server’s CORS config (origin, credentials: true) matches where your client is running.

⸻

Next steps:
	1.	Confirm the QueryClientProvider is in place.
	2.	Remove the enabled guard & add the onSuccess/onError logs.
	3.	Watch the network tab for that GET call and inspect its outcome.

Once you see exactly what’s happening at the network or query-callback level, you’ll know why isLoading never turns off—and we can drill into that specific failure.

After reviewing your code, I can confirm that the QueryClientProvider setup is correct in your App.tsx file. Now let's focus on the main issue with your React Query implementation in the BasicDashboard component.

Looking at your BasicDashboard.tsx component, I found the issue. Your useQuery hook is missing both a queryFn and onSuccess/onError handlers:

typescript
CopyInsert
const { 
  data: courses = [], 
  isLoading: isLoadingCourses, 
  error: coursesError,
  refetch 
} = useQuery<Course[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/professor/courses'],
  enabled: !!user
});
Based on the debugging steps suggested, here's what I recommend you modify in your BasicDashboard.tsx file:

      });
      
      if (!res.ok) {
        const text = await res.text();
        console.error(`API Error (${res.status}):`, text);
        throw new Error(`${res.status}: ${text}`);
      }
      
      const data = await res.json();
      console.log('📊 Courses data received:', data);
      return data;
    },
    onSuccess(data) {
      console.log('✅ Courses query succeeded:', data.length, 'courses');
    },
    onError(err) {
      console.error('❌ Courses query failed:', err);
    }
  });

Based on my review of your codebase, I've identified the likely issue with your React Query implementation. The problem appears to be that you're using React Query's global default queryFn via the queryClient configuration, but you're not providing a specific queryFn in your useQuery hook in BasicDashboard.tsx.

I've proposed changes that should resolve your infinite loading issue by:

Adding an explicit queryFn to your useQuery hook that:
Logs when it begins execution
Makes a fetch request to '/api/professor/courses'
Properly handles and logs errors
Returns the parsed JSON data
Adding onSuccess and onError callbacks that will help you debug by:
Clearly showing when the query succeeds and how many courses were returned
Providing detailed error information if the query fails
These changes will help you determine:

If the queryFn is being called at all
If there are network errors or API errors
Exactly what response you're getting from your API
This approach follows your debugging steps by:

Keeping the enabled: !!user flag but adding instrumentation
Adding console logs to verify the network request is happening
Adding callbacks to see what React Query observes
I'd also recommend checking your browser's Network tab while the app is running to confirm:

The request to '/api/professor/courses' is actually being made
What response status code you're getting
Whether there are any CORS or credentials issues
If you implement these changes and are still experiencing issues, the next step would be to examine your server implementation for the '/api/professor/courses' endpoint to ensure it's properly handling the request and returning data.
