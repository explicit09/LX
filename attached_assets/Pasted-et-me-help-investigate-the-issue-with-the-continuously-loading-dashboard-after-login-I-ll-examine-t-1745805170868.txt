et me help investigate the issue with the continuously loading dashboard after login. I'll examine the relevant files to identify the potential cause.

First, let me check the authentication setup since you're currently in the authentication-related files:

Analyzed

SimpleAuth.tsx:(1-50)
Let me check the server-side authentication code:

Analyzed

auth.ts:(1-50)
Let me also check the server's main file:

Analyzed

index.ts:(1-50)
From reviewing the code, I can see a few potential issues that could cause the continuous loading:

In SimpleAuth.tsx, there's a manual navigation function navigateToUserDashboard that redirects to either "/professor/dashboard" or "/student/dashboard" after login.
The server has CORS configured, but we should verify if the session and authentication setup is working correctly.
Let me check if there are any dashboard-related files to see how they're implemented:

Searched filesystem
3 results
Searchedforfilesinclient/src/pageswith pattern*dashboard*.tsx
Let me check one of the dashboard components:

Analyzed

Dashboard.tsx:(1-50)
Based on the code review, I can identify several potential causes for the continuous loading issue:

Authentication State: The dashboard components are using a useUser hook for authentication state, and there's debug logging in place. The continuous loading could be happening if:
The authentication state isn't being properly persisted after login
The session isn't being properly maintained between the client and server
There's an issue with CORS preventing the session cookie from being set
Route Protection: The dashboard might be stuck in a loading state if there's an issue with the authentication verification.
Let me check if there's a user context implementation:

Searched filesystem
1 result
Searchedforfilesinclient/src/libwith patternuser-context.*
Analyzed

user-context.tsx:(1-50)
Now I can see the issue more clearly. Here's what's likely happening:

The UserProvider is trying to load the user state on mount using getCurrentUser()
The dashboard is protected and depends on this user state
There's a periodic refresh of the authentication state every 3 minutes
Let me check the auth implementation:

Searched filesystem
1 result
Searchedforfilesinclient/src/libwith patternauth.*
Analyzed

auth.ts:(1-50)
Based on my investigation, I can now identify the specific issue causing the continuous loading:

After login, the application is trying to verify the user's authentication state through getCurrentUser() in the UserProvider
The dashboard is protected and won't render until this authentication check completes
The issue is likely related to one of these problems: a. Session cookie issues:
The CORS configuration might not be properly handling credentials
The session cookie might not be getting set properly after login
b. Authentication state management:
The local storage auth state might not be syncing properly with the server session
There might be an infinite loop in the authentication check
Here are the steps to fix this:

First, check if you're getting any errors in your browser's developer console (press F12 to open it)
In the Network tab of the developer tools, check if:
The /api/login request is successful
The subsequent requests to get user data are working
There are any CORS errors
Try clearing your browser's local storage and cookies, then log in again
If the issue persists, try these troubleshooting steps: a. Log out completely b. Clear your browser cache and cookies c. Try logging in again in an incognito/private window
Would you like me to look at any specific part of the code more closely or would you like to share what you see in the browser's developer console?
