## 1. Purpose & Background  
**Purpose:**  Deliver an in‑LMS, AI‑powered assistant that lets professors upload course materials and enables students to interact via chat directly with that content in a secure, course‑scoped environment.  

**Background:**  A simple, scalable course assistant where:  
- Professors ingest PDFs & audio, automatically timestamped and indexed per course.  
- Students join via access code and chat with an LLM that retrieves answers from their course’s index.  
- All interactions are logged and surfaced back to instructors as class‑wide insights.

## 4. Scope & In‑Scope Features

### 4.1 Professor Flow  
1. **Account & Course Setup**  
   - Professors register, verify email, and create/edit/delete courses.  
2. **Access Code Generation & Enrollment**  
   - System issues a unique, revocable code per course.  
3. **Content Upload & Organization**  
   - Upload PDFs & audio (max 100 MB); files auto‑timestamped and listed by date.  
4. **Indexing**  
   - Each upload enqueues re‑generation of the course’s retrieval index.  
   - Display indexing status and last‑updated timestamp.  

### 4.2 Student Flow  
1. **Account Creation & Course Join**  
   - Students register, verify email, and enter a valid access code.  
2. **Interactive Chat**  
   - Chat UI scoped to enrolled course index and persona settings.  
   - Responses draw on: course index, student persona (tone/style), and prompt rules.  
3. **Interaction Logging & Reporting**  
   - Log all questions/responses (user, timestamp, course, Q&A text).  
   - Weekly reports: top‑10 questions, common confusion points, unanswered queries.  

### 4.3 System Summary  
- **One index per course** for data isolation.  
- **Real‑time ingestion & updates**: searchable within minutes.  
- **Secure access**: invitation codes control enrollment.  
- **Feedback loop**: summarized logs surface key student questions.
